<!-- When making more pages like this one, you must change the Inherits value to match the namespace.classname
     and the Src value to match the name of the code-behind file in which that classname is defined. But do NOT
     make the namespace match that of the ExternalSiteSignon portlet -- it should remain distinct.    -->
